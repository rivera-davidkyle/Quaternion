# Quaternion
## I. Goal
The goal of this project is to create an application that would take in the values acquired from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors, and produce values (in radians) that would describe the pitch, roll, and yaw angle of the device with respect to its orientation in Earth.
